    <h2 style="color:darkblue;">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am an experienced Electronics Engineer with over 10 years in the Semiconductor industry. I am skilled in automatic test equipment(ATE) and device interface board (DIB) troubleshooting and repair.Throughout my career, I have developed a strong understanding of ATE systems and have implemented effective solutions for complex technical challenges. I have also demonstrated a strong ability to diagnose and repair DIBs, which has allowed me to maintain optimal system performance and minimize downtime.
